Mutilated test suite copied from https://github.com/pjd/pjdfstest

Usage:
- Move into mounted directory
- execute `prove ~/eecolor/sfs/pjdfstest/tests/ -r`

Replace `~/eecolor/sfs` with the location of your checkout.
You can add `-v` to get verbose output. And point to a specific test to only run that

Few notes on how to use pjdfstest in short steps:

- You currently _must_ be root when running these testcases.

An example test run is shown as follows:

	# cd pjdfstest
	# vi tests/conf
	Change 'fs' to file system type you want to test (UFS or ZFS).
	# vi Makefile
	You need to manually tweak few things by editing CFLAGS lines
	at the top of the file.
	# make
	It will compile pjdfstest utility which is used by regression tests.
	# cd /path/to/file/system/you/want/to/test/
	# prove -r /path/to/pjdfstest/tests

That's all. Enjoy.

Currently supported operating systems: FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris.
Currently supported file system types: UFS, ZFS.
